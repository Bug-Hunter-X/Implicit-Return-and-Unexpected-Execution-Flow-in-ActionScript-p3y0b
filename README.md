This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in ActionScript related to implicit returns within functions.  The `bug.as` file showcases the problematic code where a conditional return statement prematurely terminates execution under specific conditions, potentially leaving subsequent code unexecuted.  The `bugSolution.as` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue using explicit return statements and proper handling of all execution paths. The implicit return issue, while not as obvious as other errors, can cause a significant amount of difficulty for developers.
